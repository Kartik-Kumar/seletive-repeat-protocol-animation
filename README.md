# seletive-repeat-protocol-animation
This project belongs to Computer Networking Subject , just uses applet animation to show selective repeat protocol


/*
 *    This Applet was designed to be used in conjunction with
 *    "Computer Networking: A Top Down Approach"
 *    by James Kurose & Keith Ross.
 *    Terminology and specifications are based upon their description of the
 *    Selective Repeat protocol in chapter 3, section 4.
 *
 *    Written by Matthew Shatley and Chris Hoffman
 *    for Professor Paul Amer (amer@udel.edu)
 *    University of Delaware (2008)
 *
 *    Ideas for this applet are based on a Java Applet of Go Back N coded
 *    by Shamiul Azom as a project assigned by 
 *    Prof. Martin Reisslein, Arizona State University
 *    Course No. EEE-459/591. Spring 2001
 *
 *    Updated by Chris Hoffman  Fall 2011
 *    Addition of PausableThreadPoolExecutor to schedule pausable packet timers for each packet
 *    RetransmitOutstandingPackets now retransmit a single specified packet to better simulate SR
 *    Updated code layout and spacing to be more readable
 *    Each packet now has a PacketTimerTask in order to schedule a retransmission for each packet
 *
 *    A note on magic numbers: Magic numbers are horrible to have in your code in general.
 *    However, the graphics components of this applet provided no good way to remove the
 *    magic numbers from the code as locations for objects are specified in pixel coordinates. 
 *    We apologize in advance for any confusion this may cause in reading the code.

 just for my some requirement ,, i did some changes which may further reflected.
 
 NO copyright .
 
 Thanks to one who did wonderful animation to show selective repeat protocol.
